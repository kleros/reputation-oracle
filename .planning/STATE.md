## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3 coarse phases -- contract first (ABI dependency), bot second, verification last
- [Roadmap]: SETUP-01..04 merged into Phase 1 since all Foundry/on-chain work belongs together
- [Roadmap]: VER-01..04 as separate Phase 3 -- proves the full pipeline works end-to-end

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Pitfall 8 (re-registration state model) must be resolved before Phase 1 implementation -- boolean vs enum for feedback tracking
- [Research]: Pitfall 3 (non-atomic revoke-then-negative) must be handled in Router design
- [Research]: ERC-8004 giveFeedback return value needs verification against deployed Sepolia contract
